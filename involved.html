<h2>How to Get Involved in Data Carpentry</h2>

<p>
We're excited to get Data Carpentry off the ground and would love participation and engagement
at any level or types. What can you do to get involved?

	or instructing.
</ul>


<li> <b>Become an instructor</b>
	<ul>
<li> If you are already a Software Carpentry certified instructor, you are a Data Carpentry certified instructor.
	We share the same training program. If you are a Software Carpentry instructor and would like to also be a
Data Carpentry instructor, please let us know. We will also be setting up a system to figure out who is interested
in teaching what between SWC and DC in the near future.
<li> If you want to become an instructor and feel comfortable in at least two of the topic modules (spreadsheet, R or Python, SQL,
	shell), Greg Wilson is continuing to run train the trainer programs. Sign up to be notified of upcoming training opportunities
	<a href=http://software-carpentry.org/pages/register.html>http://software-carpentry.org/pages/register.html</a>
<li> Are there a lot of people at your institute or region interested in becoming instructors? contact <a href=mailto:admin@software-carpentry.org</a>admin@software-carpentry.org</a> about running a train-the-trainers at your location.
<li> If you want to see what instructing for Data Carpentry is all about, be a helper at a local DC or SWC workshop. Join the
	<a href=http://lists.software-carpentry.org/mailman/listinfo/announcements_lists.software-carpentry.org>announce list</a> to
	be notified of those opportunities.
</ul>

<li> <b>Help develop materials</b>
<p>We're currently developing our lesson materials in <a href=http://github.com/datacarpentry/datacarpentry/>GitHub</a>.
<ul>
<li> If you're familiar with GitHub head on over to the our repo and check out the lessons and submit pull requests or issues
<li> If you're interested in helping but new to GitHub, let us know and we can help with getting you started
<li> Try teaching one of the lessons as a workshop for your colleagues. Submit issues on github on what worked and didn’t
work or issue pull requests
<!--
- new to github and want to figure out how to contribute, go to docs at … Always feel free to ask for help with anything
github related. If you’re not making mistakes you’re not learning. (We think it should be the official github motto)
-->
<li> Want to propose a new module or work on a new domain? We’re working with SWC to develop lesson templates, so new lessons
can follow a standard format. Can’t wait for the template? Get in touch with us and tell us what you’re thinking about
and we’ll help with the development.
</ul>

<li> <b>Host a workshop</b>
<ul>
<li> Interested in hosting a workshop - <a href=mailto:admin@datacarpentry.org>get in touch</a>!
<br>	We don't want to commit to running them without knowing we'll have the capacity. If you're interested in hosting one though,
	please get in touch so we can start coordinating and know who's interested.
<li> Don’t know if you want to run a Data Carpentry or Software Carpentry workshop? We’re partners! Let us know your workshop
audience or questions or concerns and we’ll help you pick the right workshop for your group.
</ul>
